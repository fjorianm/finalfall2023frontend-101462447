# Using Receipt hide/show and the change of the input field to represent if the transfer transaction happen successfully or not.


  - show : the transfer transaction happened successfully. And at the same time, the value in the input field is belcome "".
  - hide : When you click on submit, the value in the input field does not belcome "" and  there is no receipt appear or the last receipt is       disappear. That means the transfer transaction does not happen. 




# The rules of how to make transfer transaction successfully

  - source account has enough balance to send the coins. In other words, input is smaller than balance.
